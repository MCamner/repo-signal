# Validate agent skills under skills/ and keep the SKILLS.md table in sync.
#
# Checks:
#   1. frontmatter name matches the skill directory
#   2. every SKILL.md has an "## Evals" section
#   3. skill cross-references ("use `<skill>`") point to existing skills
#   4. backticked file paths in SKILL.md files exist in the repo
#   5. the SKILLS.md table between the GENERATED markers matches frontmatter
#   6. every skill is discoverable, identically, through both .agents/skills/
#      (Codex) and .claude/skills/ (Claude Code), as a link into skills/ rather
#      than a copy of it
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/check-skills.sh          # check only
#   ./scripts/check-skills.sh --fix    # regenerate the SKILLS.md table
